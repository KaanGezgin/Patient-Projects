# Patient-Projects
The main purpose of this project is to compile my previous projects that have progressed to a certain extent. And it can give me an idea for the game I'm currently designing.

First project is Flight Simulation: There's not much to explain in this project, the name says it all :)

Second Project is  Building: This is for It is a project where I am doing the mechanics of placing various structures in suitable places using the device we have, found in games like subnautica, with or without using grids.

Third Project is TCG Figthing Game: This project is a project that I did with my mentor in my second internship. It is a project where games such as the classic mortal kombat in the game have a design in the form of a dynamic turn-based card game.

Fourth Project is Third Person Contoller: In this project, I tried various game mechanics with a 3rd person camera angle. I tried various game mechanics with a 3rd person camera angle. I'm trying to add side mechanics (hitting, shooting, etc.) day by day, while there are controls in games that include classic 3rd person camera angles (running, walking, sliding, etc.).
